"Is the NSA requiring masks?" as a public health service.

The NSA:

- Has [a giant warehouse full of the world's data](https://whitehouse.gov1.info/nsa/)
- Employs highly-specialized workers who are difficult to replace if they get sick
- Almost certainly has a cost-estimate analysis sitting in the bottom of a filing cabinet somewhere that marries their enormous amounts of data with the value of their people to decide if it's worth masking while at work.

With this in mind, "Is the NSA masking?" seems like a pretty good barometer for whether you should mask while at work or require others to do so.
